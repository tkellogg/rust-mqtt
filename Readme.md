mqtt.rs
=======

This is a client for the [MQTT protocol][1] written in Rust. It is not in any way complete, not even to an experimental level. Currently compiles for Rust v0.10.

Compiling:

* `make mqtt` - compile just the library
* `make example` - compile example.rs, an example for how to use this library
* `make test` - compile and run the unit tests
