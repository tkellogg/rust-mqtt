mqtt.rs
=======

This is a client for the [MQTT protocol][1] written in Rust. It is not in any way complete, not even to an experimental level. Currently compiles for Rust 1.0.

Compiling is now just the standard Cargo process.

* `cargo build` - compile just the library
* `cargo test` - compile and run the tests. Make sure a broker is running on localhost or else the tests will fail.
